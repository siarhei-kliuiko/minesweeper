In the game, mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have three states: unopened, opened and flagged. An unopened cell is clickable, while an opened cell is exposed. Flagged cells are unopened cells marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location. A player selects a cell to open it. If a player opens a mined cell, the game ends in a loss. Otherwise, the opened cell displays either a number, indicating the number of mines diagonally and/or adjacent to it, or a blank tile, and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be opened. The game ends when the player reveals all cells that do not contain mines (win) or clicks on mine (lose) and related message is displayed at the end of the game.
